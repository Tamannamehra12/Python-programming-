# Program to calculate total, percentage and grade

# Taking marks of 5 subjects as input
sub1 = float(input("Enter marks of Subject 1: "))
sub2 = float(input("Enter marks of Subject 2: "))
sub3 = float(input("Enter marks of Subject 3: "))
sub4 = float(input("Enter marks of Subject 4: "))
sub5 = float(input("Enter marks of Subject 5: "))

# Calculating total and percentage
total_marks = sub1 + sub2 + sub3 + sub4 + sub5
percentage = (total_marks / 500) * 100   # Assuming each subject is out of 100

# Determining grade
if percentage >= 90:
    grade = "A+"
elif percentage >= 80:
    grade = "A"
elif percentage >= 70:
    grade = "B"
elif percentage >= 60:
    grade = "C"
elif percentage >= 50:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"
